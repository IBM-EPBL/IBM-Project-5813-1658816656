                                   <p>A Disaster is a serious problem occuring over a short or long period of time that causes widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Disasters are routinely divided into either "Natural disaster" caused by natural hazards or "Man-made disaster" caused from anthropogenic hazards The natural disasters are Cyclone, Earthquake, Flood, Forest fire and the Man-made disasters are Biological/chemical threat, Civil disorder, Explosions, Nuclear and radiations accidents. The Objective of the project is to human build a web application to detect the type of disaster. The input is taken from thee inbuilt web cam, which in turn is given to the pre-trained model. The model predicts the type of disaster and displayed on UI.</p>
